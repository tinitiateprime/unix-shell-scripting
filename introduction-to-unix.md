### Introduction to UNIX

#### Overview of UNIX
* UNIX is a powerful, multi-user, and multitasking operating system known for its efficiency and ability to handle numerous tasks simultaneously.
* Originally developed in the 1960s at AT&T's Bell Labs, UNIX has become foundational in the development of many modern operating systems.
* Its design principles and architecture have had a profound impact on software development and system administration.

#### What is a shell? Introduction to different types of shells
* A shell in UNIX is a user interface for accessing the operating system's services.
* In simple terms, it processes commands and returns output.
* Shells come in two main types: graphical shells and command-line shells.
* Among command-line shells, several variants exist, each with unique features:

- **Bash (Bourne Again SHell)**: The most common Linux shell, known for its user-friendly scripting features.
- **Tcsh**: An enhanced version of the original C shell (csh) with additional scripting capabilities.
- **Ksh (Korn Shell)**: Combines features of both Bash and C shell, known for its effective programming and interactive use.
- **Zsh (Z Shell)**: Similar to Bash but with more enhancements such as better autocompletion and theme support.
