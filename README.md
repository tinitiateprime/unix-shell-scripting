## Basic UNIX Shell Scripting

### [Introduction to UNIX](introduction-to-unix.md)
- Overview of UNIX
- What is a shell? Introduction to different types of shells
- Basic shell commands

### [Common UNIX Commands](common-unix-commands.md)
- command: ls
- command: cd
- command: cp
- command: mv
- command: rm, rmdir
- command: touch

### [Getting Started with Shell Scripting](running-a-shellscript.md)
- Creating and running a shell script
- Making scripts executable
- Shell script structure (shebang, comments, etc.)

### [Basic Shell Commands and Constructs](shellscript-constructs.md)
- Variables and data types
- Basic operators (arithmetic, relational, logical)
- Conditional statements (`if`, `if-else`)
- Loop statements (`while`, `for`, `until`)

### Input and Output
- Reading user input (`read` command)
- Displaying output (`echo`, `printf`)
- Redirecting output to files and input from files
- Using `grep` for pattern matching

### Shell Script Debugging
- Debugging techniques (using `set -x`, `echo` statements)
- Common errors and troubleshooting tips

## Intermediate UNIX Shell Scripting

### Advanced Script Elements
- Functions: definition and scope
- Arrays and associative arrays: basics and usage
- String manipulation and processing
- Advanced use of `grep` and regular expressions

### Control Structures
- Advanced use of `if-else` and nested `if` statements
- `Case` statements for multi-way branching

### Loop Control
- Advanced loops and loop control (`break`, `continue`)
- Iterating over arrays
- Sequences and patterns in loop statements

### Advanced I/O Management
- File handling and file tests
- Here documents and here strings for multi-line input
- Command substitution and pipelines
- Managing file permissions and ownership with `chown`, `chmod`

### Process Management
- Background processes and job control
- Running commands in the background using `&` and `nohup`
- Signals and traps (catching interrupts)
- Managing user permissions with `su` and `sudo`

## Advanced UNIX Shell Scripting

### Scripting for Automation
- Automating system tasks
- Scheduling scripts using `cron` and `at`
- Writing maintainable and efficient scripts
- Scripting for network services and daemons

### Security and Portability
- Security best practices in shell scripting
- Ensuring script portability across different UNIX flavors
- Using external programs securely (e.g., `awk`, `sed`)
- Secure scripting with `sudo` and environment sanitization

### Advanced Data Processing
- Integrating `awk` and `sed` in scripts
- Regular expressions and pattern matching
- Complex text processing scenarios
- Comprehensive use of `grep` for complex patterns

### Performance Optimization
- Profiling and optimizing shell scripts
- Avoiding common pitfalls in script performance

### Real-World Applications
- Developing real-world applications using shell scripts
- Case studies of effective script utilization in administration and automation

### Exploring Further
- Introduction to scripting in other environments (e.g., Perl, Python)
- Latest trends and tools in shell scripting
